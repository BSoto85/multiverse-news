# MultiVerse News

## Introduction

MultiVerse News is an innovative React application that combines the New York Times (NYT) API with other news sources' APIs to simulate how different historical events might have unfolded if specific changes had occurred. Users can input "what if" scenarios based on real news events, and the app will use data from various news sources to visualize potential alternate timelines.

3. **Run the Frontend Application**: Start the frontend development server to run the application locally.

```
npm run dev
```

4. **Access the App**: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to access the app.

## Usage Instructions

Open the application in your browser.
Enter a historical event and a hypothetical change.
Explore the generated alternate timeline based on real news data.

## Features

**Interactive Simulations**: Input alternate history scenarios and visualize potential outcomes.

**Multiple News Sources Integration**: Combines data from the NYT API and other news APIs for accurate simulations.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and input scenarios.

**Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## User Stories:

As a history buff, I want to input an event and a specific change, so I can see how events might have unfolded differently and gain a deeper understanding of cause and effect.

As a student, I want to input various historical changes and see their outcomes, so I can better understand the relevance of history to the present and future.

As a curious mind interested in history, I want to explore alternate timelines based on real news events, so I can satisfy my curiosity about "what if" scenarios and learn about potential outcomes.

As a teacher, I want my students to propose their own "what if" scenarios and explore the results, so they can develop critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of historical cause and effect.

As a user, I want to access simulations on both desktop and mobile devices, so I can explore historical scenarios conveniently from any device.

As a user interested in historical documentaries and novels, I want to visualize the ripple effects of specific historical decisions, so I can appreciate the complexity of historical events and their long-term impacts.
